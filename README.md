# 🌵 Cactus Codex: Digital Garden

This is the source repository for my digital garden, Cactus Codex. I use [Quartz v4](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to publish Cactus Codex as a website that anyone can stumble upon and *walk through*.

Quartz is "a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully funcitonal websites" ([Quartz GitHub repository About](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)). There are many [other static-site generators](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators), so why did I choose Quartz? I chose Quartz because I enjoy writing in markdown and a couple digital gardens/second brains that I enjoy use Quartz as well (yes, that's all it took to convince me 😁):

- [Data Engineering Vault: A Second Brain Knowledge Network](https://www.ssp.sh/brain/data-engineering/), and
- [Data Glossary 🧠](https://glossary.airbyte.com/)

Consequently, Cactus Codex fully depends on the capabilities of Quartz v4. So refer to the Quartz v4 documentation for authoring content, managing configurations, and other changes.
