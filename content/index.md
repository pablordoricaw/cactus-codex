Hello there ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Pablo and welcome to ðŸŒµ *Cactus Codex* - my [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought#what-is-digital-gardening).

Before you're off to explore let me take a min to give you some context:

The purpose for my digital garden is for it to be a place that helps me think, understand ideas and learn by putting my thoughts into words. This has a couple important consequences:

- the target reader which guides all user decisions for this place is *future me*,
- the entire garden is a work in progress and can change quickly.

> If you are not *future me* and you find yourself here and at some point come across something that makes you think "why is X this way?" or "how did we get here?", you can blame *future me*.

Even if Cactus Codex is selfishly meant for *future me*, I still hope you have a fruitful time here similar to how I've found other digital gardens, second brains and blogs useful.

Pablo ðŸ™‚
